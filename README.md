# Data Visualization Portfolio
Graphs and Visualizations about Environment and Sustainability Solutions

# About me
I'm from Mexico, lived in Canada for 10 years and now I live in Japan since 2023


## My goals
I want to help to build a better world through data visualisation about Environment and Sustainability Solutions

# My plan: 
Graphs coming here soon

I will be using this datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?tags=12044-Renewable+Energy and internet search
I will be using data from https://www.enecho.meti.go.jp/statistics/total_energy/ for Japan

I will be using Datawrapper to paste my interactive graphs here https://www.datawrapper.de/
I will be using Python tools for analysis: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
I will also be learning Tableau and Power BI

# Questions I want to answer: 
1. Where is most energy (demand) used in the world and by country - For Energy Efficiency pourposes
2. What is the cost of solar pannels by country - As part of the solutions
3. Subsidies to solar pannels by country - As part of the solutions
4. Percentage of residential solar pannels by country, city and over the time
5. Savings to electric bills by country - As part of the solutions
